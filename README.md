# Data-Structures-Problem-Solving

## Project Overview

Data-Structures-Problem-Solving is a comprehensive repository focused on problem-solving using data structures and algorithms. The main aim of this repository is to aid in interview preparation and enhance the understanding of key concepts in data structures and algorithms. The repository covers a range of topics from simple array manipulations to complex graph traversals, providing a one-stop solution for brushing up on your data structures and algorithms knowledge.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with Data-Structures-Problem-Solving, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/Data-Structures-Problem-Solving.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository:

```bash
cd Data-Structures-Problem-Solving
```

3. The repository does not require any specific dependencies, but you need to have a compiler for the language in which you wish to run the code.

## Usage Examples

The repository is organized into different sections based on the type of data structure or algorithm. For example, to find problems related to arrays, navigate to the 'Arrays' section. Each problem is contained within its own directory, which includes the problem statement and the solution.

To run a solution, navigate to the solution file and run it using the appropriate compiler. For example, if you're running a Python solution:

```bash
python3 solution.py
```
